है?\n","Speaker 1: सुरेशजी, मैं आपके लोन के बारे में बात करने के लिए फोन कर रहा हूँ। आपका EMI पिछले तीन महीने से बकाया है।\n","Speaker 2: अरे हाँ, मुझे पता है। लेकिन आप लोग हर रोज फोन करके परेशान कर रहे हैं। मैंने कहा था ना कि जैसे ही पैसे होंगे, मैं भर दूंगा।\n","Speaker 1: देखिए सुरेशजी, हम समझते हैं आपकी परेशानी। लेकिन आप भी समझिए, यह हमारा काम है। आपको पता है कि आपके ऊपर कितना बकाया है?\n","Speaker 2: हाँ-हाँ, मुझे अंदाजा है। लगभग 50,000 रुपये होंगे।\n","Speaker 1: नहीं सुरेशजी, आप गलत हैं। आप पर कुल 75,000 रुपये बकाया है, जिसमें लेट फीस और ब्याज भी शामिल है।\n","Speaker 2: क्या? इतने ज्यादा? यह कैसे हो सकता है? आप लोग लूट रहे हैं क्या?\n","Speaker 1: देखिए सुरेशजी, गुस्सा करने से कुछ नहीं होगा। आपको समय पर पैसे जमा करने चाहिए थे। अब बताइए, कब तक आप यह राशि जमा कर सकते हैं?\n","Speaker 2: अरे भाई, मेरी बात तो सुनो! मेरी माँ की तबीयत खराब है, अस्पताल में भर्ती हैं। सारे पैसे उनके इलाज में खर्च हो गए।\n","Speaker 1: सुरेशजी, मुझे आपकी परिस्थिति से कोई मतलब नहीं है। हमें बस अपना पैसा चाहिए। आप समझ रहे हैं या नहीं?\n","Speaker 2: क्या बकवास कर रहे हो? तुम्हें शर्म नहीं आती? मेरी माँ मरने की कगार पर हैं और तुम पैसों की बात कर रहे हो?\n","Speaker 1: देखो सुरेश, मुझे तुम्हारी कहानियों से कोई फर्क नहीं पड़ता। तुमने लोन लिया है तो चुकाना पड़ेगा। समझे? वरना हम कानूनी कार्रवाई करेंगे।\n","Speaker 2: तुम धमकी दे रहे हो? तुम्हें पता है मैं कौन हूँ? मैं तुम्हारी नौकरी गंवा सकता हूँ।\n","Speaker 1: अरे वाह! अब तुम भी धमकी दे रहे हो? चलो, देखते हैं कौन क्या कर सकता है। तुम अपनी माँ का इलाज करवाओ, मैं तुम्हारा इलाज करूँगा।\n","Speaker 2: बदतमीज! तुम्हारी हिम्मत कैसे हुई ऐसे बात करने की? मैं तुम्हारे बॉस से शिकायत करूँगा।\n","Speaker 1: करो जो करना है। लेकिन याद रखना, अगर कल तक पैसे नहीं आए तो मैं खुद तुम्हारे घर आऊंगा। और तब देखेंगे कौन किसका इलाज करता है।\n","Speaker 2: तुम मेरे घर आओगे? ठीक है, आ जाओ। देखता हूँ कैसे आते हो। मैं पुलिस को बुला लूंगा।\n","Speaker 1: अरे वाह! पुलिस? बहुत अच्छा। हम भी देखेंगे कि पुलिस किसका साथ देती है - एक कर्जदार का या एक कानूनी कंपनी का।\n","Speaker 2: तुम... तुम बहुत बुरे इंसान हो। मेरी मजबूरी का फायदा उठा रहे हो।\n","Speaker 1: हाँ-हाँ, मैं बहुत बुरा हूँ। लेकिन तुमसे तो अच्छा ही हूँ। कम से कम मैं अपने वादे तो पूरे करता हूँ।\n","Speaker 2: क्या मतलब? मैंने कभी वादा तोड़ा है क्या?\n","Speaker 1: अरे सुरेश भाई, तुमने हर महीने EMI भरने का वादा किया था। वो क्या हुआ? भूल गए?\n","Speaker 2: देखो, मैं समझता हूँ। लेकिन अभी मेरे पास सच में पैसे नहीं हैं। क्या कोई और तरीका नहीं है?\n","Speaker 1: तरीका तो है। लेकिन उसके लिए तुम्हें कुछ करना होगा।\n","Speaker 2: क्या करना होगा? बताओ, मैं तैयार हूँ।\n","Speaker 1: पहले तो अपनी माँ का इलाज बंद करो। उन पैसों से हमारा कर्ज चुका दो।\n","Speaker 2: क्या बकवास कर रहे हो? तुम पागल हो गए हो क्या?\n","Speaker 1: अरे नहीं-नहीं, मैं तो मजाक कर रहा था। तुम तो बहुत जल्दी गुस्सा हो जाते हो।\n","Speaker 2: तुम्हें यह सब मजाक लगता है? मेरी जिंदगी बर्बाद हो रही है और तुम मजाक कर रहे हो?\n","Speaker 1: अच्छा सुनो, मैं तुम्हें एक और मौका देता हूँ। कल तक 25,000 रुपये जमा कर दो। बाकी के लिए हम एक नया प्लान बना लेंगे।\n","Speaker 2: 25,000? इतने पैसे कहाँ से लाऊँ मैं?\n","Speaker 1: वो तुम्हारी समस्या है। चाहे दोस्तों से उधार लो, या फिर कुछ बेच दो। लेकिन कल तक पैसे चाहिए।\n","Speaker 2: तुम समझ क्यों नहीं रहे हो? मेरे पास सच में पैसे नहीं हैं।\n","Speaker 1: देखो सुरेश, मुझे लगता है तुम समझ नहीं रहे हो। अगर तुम कल तक पैसे नहीं देते, तो मैं तुम्हारे ऑफिस आऊंगा और सबके सामने तुम्हारी पोल खोल दूंगा।\n","Speaker 2: नहीं-नहीं, ऐसा मत करना। मेरी इज्जत का सवाल है।\n","Speaker 1: तो फिर ठीक है। कल तक पैसे जमा कर दो। वरना तुम जानते हो क्या होगा।\n","Speaker 2: ठीक है, मैं कोशिश करूँगा। लेकिन प्लीज, मेरे ऑफिस मत आना।\n","Speaker 1: बहुत अच्छा। अब तुम समझदारी की बात कर रहे हो। याद रखना, कल शाम 5 बजे तक पैसे नहीं आए तो मैं सीधा तुम्हारे ऑफिस पहुँच जाऊंगा।\n","Speaker 2: हाँ-हाँ, मैं समझ गया। मैं पूरी कोशिश करूँगा।\n","Speaker 1: ठीक है। और हाँ, अगली बार जब लोन लो तो याद रखना - समय पर पैसे नहीं चुकाओगे तो ऐसे ही परेशान होना पड़ेगा।\n","Speaker 2: हाँ, मैं समझ गया। अब मैं रखता हूँ।\n","Speaker 1: ठीक है। और याद रखना, कल शाम 5 बजे। एक मिनट की भी देरी हुई तो...\n","Speaker 2: हाँ-हाँ, मैंने कहा ना मैं कोशिश करूँगा।\n","Speaker 1: कोशिश नहीं, करना होगा। समझे? अच्छा, अब रखता हूँ। कल मिलते हैं - या तो बैंक में, या फिर तुम्हारे ऑफिस में।\n","Speaker 2: हाँ, ठीक है। नमस्ते।\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","# Translate the conversation\n","translator =
